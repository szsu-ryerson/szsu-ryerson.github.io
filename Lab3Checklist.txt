Lab 3 Self-Assessment Checklist
Conduct and submit a self-assessment by creating and checking the following checklists:

 - All Specifications are met (list any that are not)

 - All Requirements are met (list any that are not)

 - All Code Readability, and Comments are met (list any that are not)

Identify, for each of the items above:
 - ALL that correctly achieved
 - ALL that are not correctly achieved. 
Your assessment will be marked based on its correctness, so be honest!
 - If you are unable to achieve one of the specifications, requirements, etc., this is the place to reflect on why.  
 Reasons may include:
 - ran out of time didn't understand how
 - instructions were unclear (be specific, and constructive)
 - it was not possible (describe what steps you took to determine this)
 - found a better/alternate way to complete it (if you didn't get prior permission, you may lose marks for doing this)
